# Assessing Brazilian protected areas through social media: insights from 10 years of public interest and engagement

We analyzed ten years (2011-2020) of public tweets in Portuguese language that contained content related to Brazilian PAs with the objective of answering the following questions: (i) what is the volume of posts on Twitter about Brazilian PAs? (ii) where are people communicating about Brazilian PAs? (iii) which types of Brazilian protected areas generate more posts and engagement (e.g., other users reacting to the original posts through ‘likes’, ‘retweets’, etc.)? (iv) what is the relationship between the number of posts and the engagement of users who post about PAs? (v) what are the most discussed topics in the posts?
